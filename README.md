The clean room itself is an area (room) for the control of dust particles and microorganism content. Its building structure, equipment and function can reduce the intervention, generation and retention of pollution sources in the room (area).But with the national policy adjustment.As a result of increased air pollution and the need for biosafety isolation, the application of clean rooms will be more extensive and will expand to be more compatible and inclusive.Personal view: air purification, biosafety isolation will be included in the clean room system.

Traditional application fields, such as electronics, pharmaceuticals, bioengineering, medical and health, food, cosmetics and military industries, have set off a clean room construction and technology (renovation) upgrade due to further refinement of the industry and the requirements of the new national system. The wind, this part will be no less than tens of billions of yuan / year of output value.

Due to the frequent new viruses and the need for biosafety, public places will soon be included in the construction of clean rooms. At present, it is only a development trend. If it becomes a reality, there will be hundreds of billions of output per year. It is the most brilliant period of clean room application.

In order to create a better life, some private villas and high-end residential owners have invisibly integrated the design concepts of clean rooms in interior decoration design, such as controlling pollution, controlling dust or using air-conditioning to control the controlled environment of specific industries. Already moved to the bedroom, it will be the maximum performance of clean room applications.

Through practical application, cost, biosafety isolation and application trends, the analysis concludes that the purification mode of constant efficiency operation is an opportunity given by technology. The purification engineering company has a long way to go, and using clean technology to build a clean room will definitely lead the clean room. Technology is moving in a better and faster direction.
